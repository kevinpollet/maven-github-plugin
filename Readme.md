Maven Github Plugin
===================

- **Current version** : _1.0-SNAPSHOT_
- **Deployment date** : _03/12/2011_


__This Maven plugin is under development do not use it inside production project.__

What is it ?
------------

For each Github repository there is a download section which allows people to download project tags. Sometimes project has distribution assembly which provide a functionnal application out of the box. This maven plugin allows you to deploy your project ditribution assembly to the repository download section during the build process.

How to use it ?
---------------

### Configure plugin repository

Currently, I don't have an official Maven repository. To use this plugin you have to configure my github Maven repository. To do that, look at my [maven-repository](https://github.com/kevinpollet/maven-repository) project.
	
### Add it in your build configuration

To add the _maven-github-plugin_ in your project just add the following lines

	<build>
		<plugins>
   	 	   <plugin>
   	 	       <groupId>com.github.maven.plugin</groupId>
   	 	       <artifactId>maven-github-plugin</artifactId>
   	 	       <version>PLUGIN_VERSION</version>
   	 	       //... Plugin configuration
   	 	   </plugin>
		</plugins>
	</build>

After that you have to configure the goals of the maven plugin. If you are not familiar with this step, look at [Maven documentation](http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html).

### maven-github-plugin available goals

#### maven-github-plugin:upload

- Default configuration

Without any artifact configuration (see _Specify artifacts to upload_) the plugin uploads all aartifacts in the build directory (by default `target`) who match the following expression `${project.artifactId}-${project.version}*.(jar|zip|tar.gz|tar.bz2)`. If you want to exclude files just add the following configuration in your pom.

	<configuration>
		<login>YOUR_GITHUB_LOGIN</login>
		<token>YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN</token>
		<repository>YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL</repository> (like https://github.com/kevinpollet/maven-github-plugin)
		<excludes>
			<exclude>*.zip</exclude>
		</excludes>
	</configuration>
	
_by default this goal is bounded to the deploy phase_

- Specify artifacts to upload

To specify artifacts which have to be uploaded to the repository download section just add the following lines.

	<configuration>
		<login>YOUR_GITHUB_LOGIN</login>
		<token>YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN</token>
		<repository>YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL</repository> (like https://github.com/kevinpollet/maven-github-plugin)
		<artifacts>
			<artifact>
				<file>ABSOLUTE_ARTIFACT_PATH</file>
				<description>ARTIFACT_DESCRIPTION</description>
				<override>true|false</override>
			</artifact>
		</artifacts>
	</configuration>

_by default this goal is not bounded to a lifecycle phase_

#### maven-github-plugin:list

This aim of this goal is just to list the available github repository downloads. To use this goal you have to add the configuration below in your `pom.xml`.

	<plugin>
		<groupId>com.github.maven.plugin</groupId>
		<artifactId>maven-github-plugin</artifactId>
		<version>PLUGIN_VERSION</version>
		<configuration>
			<login>YOUR_GITHUB_LOGIN</login>
			<token>YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN</token>
			<repository>YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL</repository> (like https://github.com/kevinpollet/maven-github-plugin)
		</configuration>
	</plugin>

_by default this goal is not bounded to a lifecycle phase_
